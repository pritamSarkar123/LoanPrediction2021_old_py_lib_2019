        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        Banks maintain huge amount of data related to their customers. This data is greatly used to create and keep clear-cut relationship and connection with the customers in order to target them individually for different banking offers. Data mining has gained popularity due to its different illustrative and predictive applications in banking processes which are very much efficient and effective in nature. In our project we have applied seven different machine learning algorithms. Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) is the first technique. It is one of the popular roots of Deep-Learning. MLPNN is a mutually dependent group of artificial neurons that applying a mathematical or computational model (linear and nonlinear both) for information processing using a connected approach (densely or generally) to computation. The second technique we used Decision Tree (DT) The technique Adaptive boosting (ADA) and Random Forest (RF) is the enhanced version of DT with improved classification capability. Decision tree provides powerful techniques for classification and prediction. There are many splitting category methods like Gini, Entropy etc. to build a powerful decision tree model. It can handle different categorical and continuous data for predicting the output. The third technique is Support Vector Machine (SVM). This uses a strong kernel function to increase the dimensionality to split different target categories using hyper plane. Kth Nearest Neighbor (KNN) predicts based the probability defined by the nearest k datapoints.
        <h3>Purpose of the study:</h3>In the modern days, it is very difficult to decide whether to sanction loan to a customer or not, because of the fast-paced business world. Thousands of customers turn to banks for loans, and it becomes very difficult to decide without any digital help, whether to sanction the loan. So, practically it is not possible to check all their previous records by employees themselves. So, by using data mining techniques, like the Multilayer perception neural network (MLPNN) we can accurately predict based on an individual’s past records, whether that person is eligible for obtaining the loan. This saves banks, huge amount of time and workforce. Though there are existing models for these purposes, techniques that we will apply, will further enhance the accuracy of the obtained results compared to the existing models.
        <h3>Brief Overview of th APP:</h3> A loan prediction practice dataset has been collected first. After collecting the dataset, data cleaning is thoroughly done on the dataset in the following ways. Incomplete or missing data in any row that contains numerical values, is filled using the median value (median is better than mean in case of noise avoidance) of all the data of that particular attribute. If the data are categorical, the blank spaces are filled based on the frequency of all the data in that particular attribute (the one having the highest frequency is used to fill). After the data cleaning is done, data transformation is performed. Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure for computational need. Example: - if we have 3 String or character type data to a particular feature. We convert them into 3 integers [0,1,2]. Because computation can only be performed on numerical type data. Attributes that are not important (like row number) are not considered during any calculation (Feature Selection) it reduces the overfitting problem. After feature selection we perform standardization to minimize the data range variations among different features. After standardization is done, the entire dataset was split into two parts Training dataset (70 to 80% of total data) and Testing dataset (remaining 30 to 20% of data) after being shuffled. We did not use another validation dataset as our dataset was lesser in size. Another method is Cross-validation which is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models. Then we trained different machine learning models built on MLPNN, ADA, RF, KNN and SVM until we got desired accuracy using threads in python. Those models latter successfully predicted the sanction of loan.
        
        <h3>LITERATURE OVERVIEW</h3>
        The discussions in the above sections makes it clear that the need for loan prediction is a major requirement in the banking sector. Lots of research work regarding this area are being done all over the world. Here we have presented some of the related works in this area done by other researchers. Harish Puvvada and Vamsi Mohan Ramineedi [5] have worked on loan prediction models using svm, K-Nearest Neighbours, MLP, Adaboost techniques. Vimala S., Sharmili K.C. [6] had presented a paper in the ICACT 2018 in the same area of research where they used Naïve Bayes and SVM techniques. “Bank Loan Default Prediction with Machine Learning” by Hongri Jia [7] on Apr 10,2018. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boosting was used for loan prediction. “Loan Approval Prediction based on Machine Learning Approach” by Kumar Arun, Garg Ishan, Kaur Sanmeet [8]. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Ada boost, Neural network was used for loan prediction. “An Exploratory Data Analysis for Loan Prediction Based on Nature of the Clients” by X.Francis Jency, V.P.Sumathi, Janani Shiva Sri [9] different data analytics was used.
